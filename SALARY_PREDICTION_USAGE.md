3. `getSalaryForExistingJob(jobId)` - For existing jobs
4. `formatSalary(amount)` - Helper to format currency

---

## Integration Steps

### Step 1: Add to User Profile
Edit `jobzee-frontend/src/components/UserProfile.jsx`:

```jsx
import SalaryPrediction from './SalaryPrediction';

// Add inside the profile page, perhaps after the bio section or in a sidebar
<SalaryPrediction />
```

### Step 2: Add to Job Posting Form
Edit `jobzee-frontend/src/components/EmployerPostJob.jsx`:

```jsx
import SalaryRecommendation from './SalaryRecommendation';

// Add state handler
const handleSalarySelect = (salaryData) => {
  setJobData({
    ...jobData,
    salaryMin: salaryData.min,
    salaryMax: salaryData.max
  });
  toast.success('Salary range applied!');
};

// Add component in the form, preferably near salary input fields
<div className="mb-6">
  <SalaryRecommendation 
    jobData={{
      title: jobData.title,
      skills: jobData.skills,
      location: jobData.location,
      experienceRequired: jobData.experienceRequired,
      education: jobData.education,
      category: jobData.category
    }}
    onSalarySelect={handleSalarySelect}
  />
</div>
```

### Step 3: Add to Employer Dashboard
Edit `jobzee-frontend/src/components/EmployerProfile.jsx`:

Find where jobs are displayed (likely in a map/loop) and add:

```jsx
import SalaryInsights from './SalaryInsights';

// Inside job card or expandable section
{selectedJob && (
  <SalaryInsights 
    jobId={selectedJob._id}
    jobTitle={selectedJob.title}
    currentSalary={{
      min: selectedJob.salaryMin,
      max: selectedJob.salaryMax
    }}
  />
)}
```

## Styling Notes

All components use Tailwind CSS and match the existing design system:
- Gradient backgrounds (blue/indigo for user, purple/pink for employer)
- Rounded corners with shadows
- Responsive layouts
- Icon integration with react-icons/fa
- Consistent color scheme (blue for info, green for positive, orange/red for warnings)

---

## API Endpoints Required

Ensure these backend endpoints are deployed and working:
1. `GET /api/predictions/salary/my-profile` (requires user token)
2. `POST /api/predictions/salary/for-job` (requires employer token)
3. `GET /api/predictions/salary/for-job/:jobId` (requires employer token)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Integrate components** into existing pages as described above
2. **Test with real data** once backend is deployed
3. **Adjust styling** if needed to match your exact design
4. **Add loading states** in parent components if necessary
5. **Consider mobile responsiveness** for smaller screens
6. **Add analytics tracking** for feature usage (optional)

---

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify authentication tokens are being sent correctly
3. Ensure backend endpoints are deployed and accessible
4. Check network tab for API response errors
5. Verify component props are passed correctly

Happy coding! ðŸš€
