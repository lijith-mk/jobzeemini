## 1. SVM - Support Vector Machine (Candidate Screening)

### File Location
`jobzee-backend/services/svmCandidateScreening.js`

### Purpose
Ranks and scores job applicants based on how well their profile matches job requirements using Support Vector Machine classification.

### Algorithm Details

#### Feature Extraction
The algorithm extracts **5 key features** from candidate profiles:

1. **Skills Match (40% weight)** - Most important
   - Uses TF-IDF style scoring
   - Calculates intersection of user skills vs required skills
   - Bonus for having more skills than required
   - Formula: `matchedSkills / requiredSkills + extraSkillsBonus`

2. **Experience Match (25% weight)**
   - Maps experience levels to numerical years
   - Handles overqualification (slight penalty)
   - Close matches get partial credit
   - Example mapping:
     ```javascript
     'fresher': 0, '1-2 years': 1.5, 'senior': 8, '10+': 12
     ```

3. **Education Match (15% weight)**
   - Hierarchical education levels (High School ‚Üí PhD)
   - Checks if candidate meets minimum requirements
   - Partial credit for close matches
   ```javascript
   Bachelor's: 3, Master's: 4, PhD: 5
   ```

4. **Location Match (10% weight)**
   - Remote jobs always match 100%
   - Same city = 100%, Similar region = 90%
   - Different location = 40% (relocation needed)

5. **Application History (10% weight)**
   - Profile completeness bonus
   - Past application patterns (placeholder for future)

#### SVM Decision Function

```javascript
score = (skills √ó 0.40) + (experience √ó 0.25) + (education √ó 0.15) + 
        (location √ó 0.10) + (history √ó 0.10)

// Apply sigmoid transformation for probability-like output
finalScore = 1 / (1 + e^(-5(score - 0.5)))
```

#### Classification Categories

| Score Range | Category | Badge | Confidence | Recommendation |
|-------------|----------|-------|------------|----------------|
| 85-100% | Excellent | üéØ Excellent Fit | High | Schedule interview immediately |
| 70-84% | Good | üëç Good Fit | High | Good candidate worth interviewing |
| 55-69% | Average | ‚ö° Average Fit | Medium | Review profile carefully |
| 40-54% | Below Average | ‚ö†Ô∏è Below Average | Medium | Consider only if few applicants |
| 0-39% | Poor | ‚ùå Poor Fit | Low | Not recommended |

#### Output Format
```json
{
  "score": 78,
  "classification": "good",
  "confidence": "high",

## 2. Neural Network - Salary Prediction

### File Location
`jobzee-backend/services/neuralNetSalaryPredictor.js`

### Purpose
Predicts salary ranges using a multi-layer neural network with backpropagation based on skills, experience, location, education, and job category.

### Algorithm Details

#### Network Architecture
```
Input Layer (50 neurons)
    ‚Üì
Hidden Layer 1 (32 neurons) - ReLU activation
    ‚Üì
Hidden Layer 2 (16 neurons) - ReLU activation
    ‚Üì
Output Layer (1 neuron) - Linear/Sigmoid activation
```

#### Feature Vector Composition (50 features total)

1. **Skills (30 features)** - One-hot encoding
   - Top 30 in-demand skills indexed
   - Examples: JavaScript, Python, React, AWS, ML, etc.
   ```javascript
   skillsIndex = { 'javascript': 0, 'python': 1, 'react': 3, ... }
   ```

2. **Location (10 features)** - One-hot encoding
   - Major cities: Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Pune, Remote
   ```javascript
   locationIndex = { 'bangalore': 0, 'mumbai': 1, 'remote': 8 }
   ```

   - Levels: Entry, Mid, Senior, Executive, Fresher

4. **Education Level (3 features)** - One-hot encoding
   - Levels: Bachelor's, Master's, PhD

5. **Category (2 features)** - Numerical encoding
   - Normalized category index

#### Weight Initialization
- **Xavier Initialization**: Weights scaled by `‚àö(2/fan_in)`
- Prevents vanishing/exploding gradients
- Separate weights for each layer transition

#### Activation Functions

**ReLU (Hidden Layers)**
```javascript
relu(x) = max(0, x)
```

- Momentum: 0.9
- Backpropagation with momentum for faster convergence

#### Salary Calculation
```javascript
normalizedOutput = sigmoid(networkOutput)
predictedSalary = minSalary + (normalizedOutput √ó (maxSalary - minSalary))

// Generate range (¬±15%)
lowerBound = predictedSalary √ó 0.85
upperBound = predictedSalary √ó 1.15
```

weights = {
  salary: 0.3,
  skills: 0.4,   // Most important
  location: 0.15,
  category: 0.1,
  locationType: 0.05
}

distance = (salaryDiff √ó 0.3) + ((1 - skillsSimilarity) √ó 0.4) + 
           (locationMatch √ó 0.15) + (categoryMatch √ó 0.1) + 
           (locationTypeMatch √ó 0.05)
```

#### Jaccard Similarity for Skills
```javascript
intersection = skills1 ‚à© skills2
union = skills1 ‚à™ skills2
similarity = |intersection| / |union|
```

#### Personalized Recommendations
1. **User Profile Creation**: Analyzes user's application history
   - Most applied skills
   - Preferred locations
   - Average salary range
   - Favorite categories

2. **Similarity Calculation**: Compares user profile to all available jobs

3. **Ranking**: Returns top K most similar jobs (excluding already applied)

  allJobs,      // Array of all available jobs
  'job',        // Type: 'job' or 'internship'
  5             // Number of recommendations (K)
);
```

### Use Cases
1. **"Similar Jobs" section** on job details page
2. **Personalized feed** based on browsing history

---

## 4. Naive Bayes - Personalized Recommendations

### File Location
`jobzee-backend/services/naiveBayesRecommendation.js`

### Purpose
Uses probabilistic classification to recommend jobs based on user's past application patterns.

### Algorithm Details

#### Naive Bayes Theorem
```
P(applied|features) = P(features|applied) √ó P(applied) / P(features)

where:
- P(applied) = prior probability of applying
- P(features|applied) = likelihood of features given application
- P(features) = evidence (normalizing constant)
```

#### Feature Extraction
Features are extracted as string identifiers:
- `skill:javascript`, `skill:python`
- `location:bangalore`, `location:remote`
- `type:full-time`, `type:contract`
- `salary:high`, `salary:medium`, `salary:low`
- `duration:short`, `duration:long` (internships)

Example:
```javascript
['skill:react', 'skill:node', 'location:bangalore', 
 'salary:high', 'type:full-time', 'remote:yes']
```

#### Training Process

1. **Separate Data**:
   - Class 0: Jobs user has applied to
   - Class 1: Jobs user hasn't applied to

2. **Calculate Class Probabilities**:
   ```javascript
   P(applied) = appliedJobs / totalJobs
   P(notApplied) = notAppliedJobs / totalJobs
   ```

3. **Calculate Feature Probabilities** (with Laplace Smoothing):
   ```javascript
   P(feature|applied) = (count(feature in applied) + 1) / 
                        (total features in applied + vocabulary size)
   ```

4. **Laplace Smoothing**: Prevents zero probabilities for unseen features

#### Prediction Process
```javascript
// Calculate log probabilities to avoid underflow
logP(applied|features) = log(P(applied)) + 
                         Œ£ log(P(feature_i|applied))

logP(notApplied|features) = log(P(notApplied)) + 
                            Œ£ log(P(feature_i|notApplied))

// Normalize to get probability
probability = exp(logP(applied)) / 
             (exp(logP(applied)) + exp(logP(notApplied)))
```

#### Output Format
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Full Stack Developer",
    "skills": ["React", "Node.js"],
    "recommendationScore": 87,
    "recommendationMethod": "naive_bayes"
  },
  {
    "title": "Frontend Engineer",
    "skills": ["React", "TypeScript"],
    "recommendationScore": 82,
    "recommendationMethod": "naive_bayes"
  }
]
```

### API Usage
```javascript
const recommendations = await naiveBayes.getPersonalizedRecommendations(
  userApplications,  // User's past applications
  allJobs,          // All available jobs
  'job',            // Type
  10                // Limit
);
```

### Use Cases
1. **Homepage personalized feed**
2. **Email recommendations**: "Jobs you might like"
3. **Re-engagement**: Bring back inactive users

## 5. Decision Tree - Application Success Prediction

### File Location
`jobzee-backend/services/decisionTreePrediction.js`

### Purpose
Predicts the likelihood of getting hired by analyzing how well a candidate's profile matches job requirements.

### Algorithm Details

#### Decision Tree Structure
```
                    Root: Skills Match?
                   /                    \
            >= 70%                    < 70%

## Integration Examples

### Example 1: Complete Candidate Screening Flow
```javascript
// 1. Get all applications for a job
const applications = await Application.find({ job: jobId })
  .populate('userId', 'name skills experience education location');

// 2. Screen candidates with SVM
const { candidates, stats } = await svmScreening.screenCandidates(
  applications.map(app => app.userId),
  job,
  'job'
);

// 3. Display ranked candidates
candidates.forEach(candidate => {
  console.log(`${candidate.aiScreening.rank}. ${candidate.name}`);
  console.log(`   Score: ${candidate.aiScreening.score}%`);
  console.log(`   Badge: ${candidate.aiScreening.badge}`);
  console.log(`   Recommendation: ${candidate.aiScreening.recommendation}`);
});
```

### Example 2: Personalized Job Recommendations
```javascript
// Get user's application history
const userApps = await Application.find({ userId })
  .populate('job');

// Get all available jobs
const allJobs = await Job.find({ status: 'active' });

// Method 1: KNN (similar to what user applied to)
const knnRecs = await knnRecommendation.getPersonalizedRecommendations(
  userApps,
  allJobs,
  'job',
  5
);

// Method 2: Naive Bayes (probabilistic)
const bayesRecs = await naiveBayes.getPersonalizedRecommendations(
  userApps,
  allJobs,
  'job',
  5
);

// Combine and deduplicate
const recommendations = [...knnRecs, ...bayesRecs]
  .sort((a, b) => b.recommendationScore - a.recommendationScore)
  .slice(0, 10);
```

### Example 3: Pre-Application Success Check
```javascript
// Before user applies, show success prediction
const userProfile = await User.findById(userId);
const job = await Job.findById(jobId);

const prediction = decisionTree.predictApplicationSuccess(
  userProfile,
  job,
  'job'
);

// Show modal with prediction
res.json({
  canApply: true,
  prediction: {
    probability: prediction.successProbability,
    message: prediction.recommendation,
    factors: prediction.factors,
    tips: prediction.feedback
