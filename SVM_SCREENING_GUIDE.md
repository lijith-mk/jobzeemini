# SVM Candidate Screening - Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Overview

Your job platform now features **AI-powered candidate screening** using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. This helps employers automatically rank and evaluate job applicants based on their profile match with job requirements.

## ✅ What's Implemented

### Backend (Fully Working)

**Location:** `jobzee-backend/services/svmCandidateScreening.js`

- ✅ SVM classification algorithm with weighted features
- ✅ Skills matching with cosine similarity (40% weight)
- ✅ Experience level assessment (25% weight)
- ✅ Education qualification matching (15% weight)
- ✅ Location compatibility check (10% weight)
- ✅ Profile completeness scoring (10% weight)
- ✅ Sigmoid transformation for probability-like scores
- ✅ Candidate ranking system

**API Endpoints:** `jobzee-backend/routes/screeningRoutes.js`

```
GET /api/screening/job/:jobId/candidates
GET /api/screening/internship/:internshipId/candidates
POST /api/screening/single-candidate
```

### Frontend (Just Added!)

**Component:** `jobzee-frontend/src/components/SVMCandidateScreening.jsx`

- ✅ Beautiful gradient UI with stats overview
- ✅ Ranked candidate display with badges
- ✅ Match score visualization with color-coded progress bars
- ✅ Feature breakdown (skills, experience, education, location, history)
- ✅ Strengths and gaps identification
- ✅ AI recommendations for each candidate
- ✅ Show/hide details toggle
- ✅ Responsive design

**Integration:**
- ✅ Job Applications page (`JobApplications.jsx`)
- ✅ Internship Applications page (`InternshipApplications.jsx`)

## 🎨 Features

### 1. **Candidate Ranking**
- Top 3 candidates get special badge colors (Gold 🥇, Silver 🥈, Bronze 🥉)
- Automatic sorting by match score

### 2. **Classification System**
- **Excellent** (85%+): 🎯 Green badge - "Strongly recommended"
- **Good** (70-84%): 👍 Blue badge - "Recommended"
- **Average** (55-69%): ⚡ Amber badge - "Consider carefully"
- **Below Average** (40-54%): ⚠️ Orange badge - "Weak candidate"
- **Poor** (<40%): ❌ Red badge - "Not recommended"

### 3. **Visual Insights**
- Overall match score with gradient progress bar
- 5 feature scores (skills, experience, education, location, history)
- Strengths highlighted in green boxes
- Improvement areas in orange boxes

### 4. **Statistics Dashboard**
- Total candidates screened
- Count by classification (Excellent, Good, Average)
- Average score across all candidates

## 📖 How to Use

### For Employers

1. **Post a Job/Internship** with clear requirements:
   - Required skills
   - Experience level
   - Education requirements
   - Location details

2. **Wait for Applications** from candidates

3. **View AI Screening**:
   - Navigate to: **My Jobs** → **View Applications**
   - The SVM screening appears automatically at the top
   - Shows ranked candidates with match scores

4. **Review Top Candidates**:
   - Focus on candidates with 70%+ match scores
   - Review strengths and gaps for each candidate
   - Use AI recommendations to make hiring decisions

5. **Details View**:
   - Click "Show Details" to see full feature breakdown
   - View all candidates beyond top 5
   - Analyze specific strengths and weaknesses

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Algorithm Weights

```javascript
{
  skills: 0.40,      // 40% - Most important
  experience: 0.25,  // 25%
  education: 0.15,   // 15%
  location: 0.10,    // 10%
  history: 0.10      // 10% - Profile completeness
}
```

### Score Calculation

1. **Feature Extraction**: Analyze candidate profile vs job requirements
2. **Linear Combination**: Weighted sum of all features
3. **Sigmoid Transformation**: Convert to 0-100% probability score
4. **Classification**: Assign category and recommendation

### Skills Matching

- Case-insensitive matching
- Exact match scoring
- Bonus for extra skills (shows initiative)
- Cosine similarity approach

### Experience Matching

- Handles both job experience and academic years
- Detects overqualification (slight penalty)
- Close match tolerance (70%+ acceptable)

### Education Matching

- Multi-level degree hierarchy
- "Any" education requirement support
- Partial credit for lower degrees

### Location Matching

- Remote/hybrid jobs always match
- Exact location preferred
- Partial match for same region
- Relocation penalty applied

## 🎬 Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Create Test Job**:
   ```
   Title: Senior React Developer
   Skills: React, Node.js, TypeScript, AWS
   Experience: 3-5 years
   Education: Bachelor's in Computer Science
   Location: San Francisco
   ```

2. **Create Test Candidates** with varying profiles:
   - Perfect match candidate (should score 85%+)
   - Good match candidate (70-84%)
   - Below average candidate (<55%)

3. **View Screening**:
   - Go to job applications page
   - Check if SVM component loads
   - Verify ranking and scores make sense

### API Testing

```bash
# Get screening for a job (replace tokens and IDs)
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/screening/job/{JOB_ID}/candidates \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {EMPLOYER_TOKEN}"
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No candidates to screen yet"
- ✅ This is normal if no one has applied
- Wait for applications to come in

### Screening not loading
- ✅ Check browser console for errors
- ✅ Verify backend is running on port 5000
- ✅ Ensure employer is logged in (valid token)

### Scores seem incorrect
- ✅ Check job requirements are properly filled
- ✅ Ensure candidates have complete profiles
- ✅ Review algorithm weights in backend service

### Component not showing
- ✅ Verify at least 1 application exists
- ✅ Check import statement in page component
- ✅ Look for console errors
